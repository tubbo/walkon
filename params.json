{"name":"Walkon","tagline":"Entrance music for your office.","body":"# Walkon\r\n\r\nWalkon plays your entrance music. It's a daemon process that\r\nperiodically checks `hcitool scan` for new Bluetooth devices, then uses\r\ntheir ESSIDs to find tracks to play as they leave or exit the network.\r\n\r\n## Installation\r\n\r\nWalkon requires the following components to have already been installed:\r\n\r\n- [Ubuntu][ubu] (for best results, but any Linux that supports BlueZ will do)\r\n- [Ruby][rb] 2.x or above\r\n- [BlueZ][bz], the official Linux Bluetooth protocol stack\r\n- [XMMS][xm], a command-line audio player for Linux\r\n\r\nInstall it yourself:\r\n\r\n```bash\r\n$ gem install walkon\r\n```\r\n\r\nThen, run:\r\n\r\n```bash\r\n$ walkon setup\r\n```\r\n\r\nYou must also connect speakers to your machine's soundcard output in\r\norder to actually hear tracks...\r\n\r\n## Usage\r\n\r\nPlace an MP3 in `/music` that corresponds with your device's ESSID.\r\nSo, if your device's name is \"iPhone5\", you would upload a track like\r\nso:\r\n\r\n```bash\r\n$ scp your-track.mp3 walkon:/music/iPhone5.mp3\r\n```\r\n\r\nTo find out more about how it works, read the [Documentation][docs].\r\n\r\n## Contributing\r\n\r\n1.
